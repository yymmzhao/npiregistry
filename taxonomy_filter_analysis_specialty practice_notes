Do the following analysis: 

1. Create a separate sheet for each taxonomy with names, not codes
2. In each sheet, calculate the following metrics
  - How many are individuals and organizations (Individual: Entity Type Code = 1; Organization: Entity Type Code = 2)
  - How many individuals and organizations are in each borough (based on the zip codes you had in the last script)
  - Among the individuals, how many are Sole Proprietors and not a Sole Proprietor? （Individual: Entity Type Code = 1； Is Sole Proprietor = Y, Sole Proprietor； Is Sole Proprietor = N, Not a Sole Proprietor； Is Sole Proprietor = X, Not Answered）
  - Among the individuals, how many are Male, Female, or Undisclosed? (Individual: Entity Type Code = 1; Provider Sex Code = M, Male; Provider Sex Code = F, Female; Provider Sex Code = U, Undisclosed; Provider Sex Code = X, Undisclosed)
  - Multidisciplinary capability". 1. How many of them only have one taxonomy code, seperate number for individuals and organizations. 2. How many of them have more than one taxonomy codes, and all of them are in the taxonomy codes I listed. 3. How many of them have more than one taxonomy codes, some of them has the code I listed, but some of them are other codes. 
3. Create a “Summary" sheet to summarize all this information with counts and percentages
4. Create a new spreadsheet for the outcome named "npi_nyc taxonomy analysis_specialty practice"

Provide a Python script for Jupyter
